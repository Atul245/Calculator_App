# Windows Forms Calculator

This repository contains the source code and step-by-step instructions to build a basic Windows Forms Calculator using the C# programming language and Visual Studio IDE.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Visual Studio IDE installed on your machine. You can download it from the official [Visual Studio website](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/).
- Basic understanding of C# programming language and Windows Forms application development.

## Getting Started

To get started with building the Windows Forms Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.

2. Open Visual Studio IDE.

3. Click on "Open a project or solution" and navigate to the directory where you cloned or downloaded the repository. Open the solution file (.sln).

4. Once the solution is opened, you will see the project structure in the Solution Explorer.

5. Open the `Form1.cs` file in the Visual Studio editor.

6. Design the user interface of the calculator by dragging and dropping controls from the Toolbox onto the form. For example, you can add buttons for numbers, operators, and a text box to display the result.

7. Implement the event handlers for the buttons. For example, you can handle the click event of the number buttons to update the display or perform calculations based on the operator buttons.

8. Build the project by clicking on the "Build" menu and selecting "Build Solution" or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+B`.

9. Once the project is built successfully, you can run the calculator by clicking on the "Start" button or pressing `F5`.
